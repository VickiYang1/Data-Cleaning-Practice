# SQL Data Cleaning Scripts

This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts focused on cleaning and preparing messy datasets for analysis.  

Each script addresses common real-world issues such as:  
- Handling missing, blank, or invalid values  
- Standardizing column types and formats  
- Removing duplicates  
- Splitting or restructuring columns  
- Correcting inconsistent calculations  
- Creating final cleaned tables for analysis  

## Datasets Covered
- **Employee Dataset** – Fixed missing names, standardized ages and salaries, split combined department/region fields, and cleaned join dates.  
- **Cafe Sales Dataset** – Standardized transaction IDs, recalculated totals, cleaned payment methods, locations, and transaction dates.  

## Purpose
The goal of this repo is to demonstrate practical SQL cleaning techniques across different types of datasets, ensuring data integrity and readiness for downstream analysis.
